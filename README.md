# COMP249_assignment
Holds the source code of the COMP 249 assignment on inheritance as written by the Droids

The folder “comp249_assignment” within the repository is the project folder. Once you pull the contents of the repository into your computer, add this folder to your workspace on Eclipse. That way, you don't need to worry about looking up the appropriate project every time you open the IDE. Sorry if these instructions seem obvious, they weren't for me when I first started messing around git and github :p
